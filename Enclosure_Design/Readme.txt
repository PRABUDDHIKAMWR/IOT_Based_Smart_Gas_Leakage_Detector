# Enclosure Design

This folder contains the design files for the enclosure of our product. The design was created using SOLIDWORKS 2020.

The enclosure consists of two main parts:

1. **Base**: This is the bottom part of the enclosure that houses the main components of our product.

2. **Lid**: This is the top part of the enclosure that fits onto the base to protect the internal components.

Each part has been designed with precision to ensure a secure fit and proper ventilation for the internal components.

Please ensure you have SOLIDWORKS 2020 or later to open and modify these files. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
